                    <h3>Cycle founder, Abdalrahman Jarwan
                    </h3>
                    <p>Cycle was an idea that its main point is to help all gamers and PC users to afford PC equipment
                        with high-quality and cheap prices. Abdal and his friends enjoyed video games during their
                        school period. While they were at school, they always would check each other’s equipment’s and
                        sometimes trade to test new products.
                        <br /><br />
                        Cycle is a project where it’s a safer, easier, and a cheaper way to connect all the users out
                        there
                        to sell, trade, and buy used products. The name Cycle came from the idea where instead of
                        throwing a product you are replacing; others might want to try it. It all goes in a cycle to
                        make
                        sure everyone can use these products. Our mission is to provide affordable products to all users
                        with the satisfaction of the quality needed.
                    </p>
